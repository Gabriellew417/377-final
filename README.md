## INST377 Final Project - TERP Weather System

### This Website was designed to help busy students at UMD have easier access to weather data. There are three pages for our project with the main page that displays all necessary resources that a student might need at UMD.

#### Most students will either be on their phones or on their school laptops. Our specific website will cater to web browsers like google chrome.


## Our Audience

#### our audience is not only students but also busy individuals preparing for their day. What our website displays is a very simplistic design that allows all individuals to see what weather conditions, weekly weather forecasts and the nightly and daily recorded tempatures.
